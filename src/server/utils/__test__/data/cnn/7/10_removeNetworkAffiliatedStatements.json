Our Hari Sreenivasan sits down   with the veteran filmmaker and mountaineer, David Breashears. Welcome to the program, everyone.  I`m Christiane Amanpour in London. Plenty of Democrats are throwing their names forward to challenge President Trump for the 2020 presidency.  Among them is Pete Buttigieg. He`s known   around town in South Bend, Indiana as Mayor Pete.  He is the quintessential long shot and would be a president of firsts.  The first to be elected in   his 30s, the first millennial, the first openly gay commander in chief and the first mayor. And on that point, that was a transition that many thought could be made by the former New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg.  Although, the billionaire   has now ruled himself out of the race. Buttigieg brings a new generation approach, vowing huge structural changes in order to get the U.S. working for a majority of the people.  And if that   sounds ambitious and grand, he says it`s meant to.  And it`s worth considering that this year, millennials will overtake baby boomers as the   largest voting bloc in America. Pete Buttigieg is only 37 years old, but he`s been a business consultant, an officer in the Navy Reserve and he`s served in Afghanistan in 2014 and   he`s joining me now from South Bend, Indiana. Mr. Mayor, welcome to the program."

I didn`t go around saying that I alone can fix   it, I didn`t beat my chest and say we`re going to make South Bend great again.  I believe you cannot have an honest politics that revolves around   the word again. And so, my very first task at the beginning of this decade when I became mayor was to have a dialogue with the community about how we could still   succeed and thrive without pretending that we could turn back to the 1960s. when so many people were employed here in auto factories. We still have advanced manufacturing, we`re proud of it.  But we also recognize that it`s less labor intensive than it used to be and has to be   augmented with other sources of economic growth, including things like data analytics and industries that didn`t even exist when the last car rolled   off the line here in 1963.  And I`m afraid that my party really has failed to engage the industrial Midwest and other smaller communities. I think we learned to do a better job of that in 2018 in the midterm elections.  Now, it`s time to do that at the highest level in this   presidential nominating process in 2020."

For example, it turned out that power substations that were almost irrelevant around here   had new utility, not powering factories, they had nothing left to power, but powering data centers, which is how some of the new jobs   were created. When it came to our neighborhoods in resolving the issue of vacant abandoned homes, an issue that plagues so many, rural and industrial   communities, especially in my part of the country, the American Midwest, we had to mobilize resources, get creative about different options, engage   with federal partners and above all, reassure people in the neighborhoods impacted that this was going to be done with them and not to them. There`s a great many people and this is true whether we`re talking about people`s relationship to their local city government or to the national   government.  There`s a great many people who have given up on the idea that the government has their best interests at hear.  We found ways to rebuild   trust through both technological means, gathering more data about what was happening in our city to serve residents better, but also low-tech means,   simple engagement and trust building that I believe now needs to be restored at the national level. I get that it`s unconventional for somebody with a mayoral background to talk about the highest office in the land when a more typical background   would be having been in Washington, kind of marinating it in that environment, maybe in the Congress for many years."

And if that`s a low bar, I also have more years of executive experience in government than the vice president and more   military experience than anybody who has arrived in that office on day one since George H.W. Bush. So, it may sound a little cheeky as the youngest person in the conversation, but I would say experience is one of the main reasons that I   belong at the table.  I would also say that generational change is something that can help us appeal to more people of every generation.  You   know, three out of the last four presidents are exactly the same age.  Presidents Bush, Clinton and Trump were all born within a few weeks of each   other in the summer of 1946. Now, I don`t mean to say that you need to be a certain age or not be a certain age in order to serve but I do think that a lot of people are   emerging from my generation, you see some of them some of them changing the character of the United States Congress right now and I think we need to   that in executive leadership because I belong to the generation that experienced school shootings as the norm.  I was in high school when the   Columbine shooting happened.  I belong to the generation that provided most of the troops, including myself, in the conflicts after 9/11 and is bearing   the burden of the forever war and I belong to the generation that is going to be on the business end of issues like climate change for the rest of our   lives. We can even statistically be on track to be the first generation in American history to make less than our parents if something isn`t done."

And I think if you regard the condition of the country or the world in that year not as somebody else`s problem but as something you`re personally   preparing for, it gives you a different kind of voice to speak about these issues. Look, we definitely need these bold reforms and we need people who aren`t afraid to speak with conviction.  Even as I think the traditional left   center spectrum for assessing the Democratic party has, if anything, become a little bit less useful than before, I do think that a lot of voters,   including voters here in the industrial Midwest who might be considered independent or even conservative leaning, will pay more attention   to voices from my party if we`re talking about addressing the fundamental problems that made a presidency like this one and an election   like to 2016 election even possible. I would argue that this is a symptom.  And the causes have to do with structural problems, deep problems in our economy and in our democracy that   have left far too many, especially in communities like mine in the American interior, feeling like the system wasn`t working for them, which is why I   get a great many of them, mostly or at least largely, with no illusions about the character of the current president, still deciding to go into   that voting booth and vote effectively to burn the House down, which unfortunately is what we got."

And he`s really identifying the problem with our democracy before we attend to   any of the other issues that we care about from economic issues to things like climate change. We in America have to ask whether our democratic republic is as democratic as we think.  I`s one of the reasons I`ve called for some straight forward   but perhaps bold solutions like doing away with the Electoral College that twice in my lifetime has overruled the American people. I mean, when you have -- take universal background checks, a commonsense gun policy, that`s something like 80 or 90 percent of Americans agree on.    If the U.S. Congress can`t deliver something that that many Americans, including most Republicans believe is the right thing to do, is evidence   that money and the drawing of constituency lines so that politicians are choosing their voters instead of the other way around, it`s evidence that   our democracy has become warped almost beyond recognition and needs to be reformed immediately."

And so, I think we need to entertain a range of reforms that would make the Supreme   Court less political so that each vacancy didn`t become another apocalyptic ideological battle. For example, it may be possible, without even amending the Constitution, to adjust the structure of the Supreme Court so that it had 15 members but   only 10 of them were appointed politically, the other were rotated up from the appellate bench and could only be seated by unanimous consensus among   the other 10.  That`s just one of a number of reforms that have been proposed and I don`t presume to know what the exact right answer is.  I do   believe that something that may be in the past was considered off limits because it`s too deep or too structural.  These kinds of things need to be   entertained because our democracy is very much in danger of slipping away from us. You know, Freedom House did its assessment of freedom and democracy around the world and the United States rankings are slipping, some say that we`re   in a democracy recession globally.  And here at home, I`m very much worried that democracy is in retreat unless we repair our institutions, something   that we used to be willing to do through statute and constitutional change, every generation would see some range of reforms take place. And for some reason, that`s just stopped short.  And if anything, we`re growing less democratic in my lifetime with measures to make it more   difficult for many Americans to vote and increasing distortion with the role of money in our politics too."

Look, an election against a candidate as flawed as he was in 2016, that should never have even come within cheating distance, so to speak, it   should never have been close.  I believe that for an election result like that, for a presidency like this even to be possible there must be more   profound issues in our economy and democracy such that the problem, if it weren`t him, could very well be somebody else causing similar damage. Of course, he needs to be defeated, when he says something false it needs to be corrected, when he does something wrong it needs to be confronted.    But fundamentally, this election can`t be simply about him.  If the message is all about him, I can tell you that once again a lot of people,   especially in the industrial regions where I live, will say that nobody`s talking about me.  We have to talk about lived every day experience of   people in their lives across America and how our values and the policies that flow from those values will make every day of life better.  It can`t   be all about him, that`s the show and he`s very good at making that show all about him.

I was running for reelection, Mike Pence was the   governor of my state at the time, but I knew that it was something I had to do.  My community is socially conservative and we didn`t know what the   response would be.  But when I explain myself and continued going about doing my job, I wound up getting reelected with 80 percent of the vote. So, I think what we`ve learned is that more than anything, people want to know what you care about, what your values are, what your ideas are and   what kind of jobs you can do for them.  That`s how I`m evaluated by my constituents here at home in South Bend. And of course, I`m proud of my marriage.

But one thing I have observed on, everything from LGBTQ equality, to the treatment of   immigrants is -- were always a lot better toward people we actually know. When we begin to concretize these stories and make sure that people understand, we`re not talking about some group out there but real human   beings, many of whom you might be related to or crossed paths with in your community, it`s just harder to hate from up close and it`s one of the   antidote that I think a locally oriented political style can bring to a national conversation that is leaving far too many marginalized groups   behind."

Maybe the most important thing I took from it was a better sense of what it was to be an American, because the people that I served with,   especially when I was responsible for driving or guarding vehicles on convoys movements, which is a big part of my job when I was posted in   Kabul, was that, you know, we would learn to trust each other with our lives regardless of our backgrounds.  People getting into my vehicle didn`t   care if I was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend or what country my father had immigrated from or whether I was a Democrat or Republican, we   simply learn to trust each other with our lives. And in a broader sense, I think that`s what has to happen in America but you shouldn`t have to go to war in order to have that experience.  I   believe that national service is something we need to create more opportunities for here at home and we really need to learn from all of the   ways in which for prior generations. Military service was often a leveler, an equalizer, something that made it possible for people like a young John F. Kennedy or George H.W. Bush to   learn how to relate on more or less equal terms with the sons of factory workers and farmers in places like Indiana.  And it`s unfortunate that   we`ve lost that to some degree, but I think there`s a chance, certainly not now led by a president who is credibly accused of faking a disability in   order to avoid service when it was his turn. But I do think there`s an opportunity to restore a culture of service to the heart of what it means to be in this country."

And what happened were a couple of teams climbing   very high on the mountain got caught out late, climbing too late. And at that same moment when they were very vulnerable, they were overcome by a fast-moving storm that was not forecasted, that was -- came out of a   different direction than we normally expect. And in that night, eight people froze to death and some were severely frostbitten.  One gentleman lost both of his hands to frostbite eventually.    And it was just complete chaos on the mountain during the storm. And it was something that we had never really seen on Everest, a mix of guiding, a mix of professional climbers, a mix of clients who are less   experienced, all within a couple of hours -- within an hour, really, in the dramatic fight for their lives."

And then I was there during the earthquake. And so I`ve been on the glacier doing work for Glacierworks when there`s 1,400 people arrayed on that glacier.  When I was there in 1985, we were   one team.  We were 38 people. And I`ve been able to go to the mountain many times and fulfill something I wanted to do in life and to make films.  I don`t know what to say about   people who have the same feelings.  They just want to get to the top.

Our Hari Sreenivasan sits down   with the veteran filmmaker and mountaineer, David Breashears. Welcome to the program, everyone.  I`m Christiane Amanpour in London. Plenty of Democrats are throwing their names forward to challenge President Trump for the 2020 presidency.  Among them is Pete Buttigieg. He`s known   around town in South Bend, Indiana as Mayor Pete.  He is the quintessential long shot and would be a president of firsts.  The first to be elected in   his 30s, the first millennial, the first openly gay commander in chief and the first mayor. And on that point, that was a transition that many thought could be made by the former New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg.  Although, the billionaire   has now ruled himself out of the race. Buttigieg brings a new generation approach, vowing huge structural changes in order to get the U.S. working for a majority of the people.  And if that   sounds ambitious and grand, he says it`s meant to.  And it`s worth considering that this year, millennials will overtake baby boomers as the   largest voting bloc in America. Pete Buttigieg is only 37 years old, but he`s been a business consultant, an officer in the Navy Reserve and he`s served in Afghanistan in 2014 and   he`s joining me now from South Bend, Indiana. Mr. Mayor, welcome to the program."

I believe you cannot have an honest politics that revolves around   the word again. And so, my very first task at the beginning of this decade when I became mayor was to have a dialogue with the community about how we could still   succeed and thrive without pretending that we could turn back to the 1960s. when so many people were employed here in auto factories. We still have advanced manufacturing, we`re proud of it.  But we also recognize that it`s less labor intensive than it used to be and has to be   augmented with other sources of economic growth, including things like data analytics and industries that didn`t even exist when the last car rolled   off the line here in 1963.  And I`m afraid that my party really has failed to engage the industrial Midwest and other smaller communities. I think we learned to do a better job of that in 2018 in the midterm elections.  Now, it`s time to do that at the highest level in this   presidential nominating process in 2020."

For example, it turned out that power substations that were almost irrelevant around here   had new utility, not powering factories, they had nothing left to power, but powering data centers, which is how some of the new jobs   were created. When it came to our neighborhoods in resolving the issue of vacant abandoned homes, an issue that plagues so many, rural and industrial   communities, especially in my part of the country, the American Midwest, we had to mobilize resources, get creative about different options, engage   with federal partners and above all, reassure people in the neighborhoods impacted that this was going to be done with them and not to them. There`s a great many people and this is true whether we`re talking about people`s relationship to their local city government or to the national   government.  There`s a great many people who have given up on the idea that the government has their best interests at hear.  We found ways to rebuild   trust through both technological means, gathering more data about what was happening in our city to serve residents better, but also low-tech means,   simple engagement and trust building that I believe now needs to be restored at the national level. I get that it`s unconventional for somebody with a mayoral background to talk about the highest office in the land when a more typical background   would be having been in Washington, kind of marinating it in that environment, maybe in the Congress for many years."

Bush. So, it may sound a little cheeky as the youngest person in the conversation, but I would say experience is one of the main reasons that I   belong at the table.  I would also say that generational change is something that can help us appeal to more people of every generation.  You   know, three out of the last four presidents are exactly the same age.  Presidents Bush, Clinton and Trump were all born within a few weeks of each   other in the summer of 1946. Now, I don`t mean to say that you need to be a certain age or not be a certain age in order to serve but I do think that a lot of people are   emerging from my generation, you see some of them some of them changing the character of the United States Congress right now and I think we need to   that in executive leadership because I belong to the generation that experienced school shootings as the norm.  I was in high school when the   Columbine shooting happened.  I belong to the generation that provided most of the troops, including myself, in the conflicts after 9/11 and is bearing   the burden of the forever war and I belong to the generation that is going to be on the business end of issues like climate change for the rest of our   lives.

You know, I think about these issues as personal ones.  I think about what the world will look like when I reach   the current age of the current president, which is the year 2054. And I think if you regard the condition of the country or the world in that year not as somebody else`s problem but as something you`re personally   preparing for, it gives you a different kind of voice to speak about these issues. Look, we definitely need these bold reforms and we need people who aren`t afraid to speak with conviction.  Even as I think the traditional left   center spectrum for assessing the Democratic party has, if anything, become a little bit less useful than before, I do think that a lot of voters,   including voters here in the industrial Midwest who might be considered independent or even conservative leaning, will pay more attention   to voices from my party if we`re talking about addressing the fundamental problems that made a presidency like this one and an election   like to 2016 election even possible. I would argue that this is a symptom.  And the causes have to do with structural problems, deep problems in our economy and in our democracy that   have left far too many, especially in communities like mine in the American interior, feeling like the system wasn`t working for them, which is why I   get a great many of them, mostly or at least largely, with no illusions about the character of the current president, still deciding to go into   that voting booth and vote effectively to burn the House down, which unfortunately is what we got."

So, I mean, you`re pretty much summing up the   political dysfunction that`s underway in terms of what people feel that they`re missing and lacking. But to that point, then let me ask you to comment on what Tim Wu, a Columbia law professor and a real sort of analyst of these times, wrote   today in \"The New York Times.\"  He`s talking about on issues of higher taxes, paid maternity leave and Medicare, all the things that many are now   talking about, \"The defining political fact of our time is not polarization, it`s the inability of even large bipartisan majorities to get   what they want on issues like these.  Call it the oppression of the super majority, ignoring what most of the country wants, such as demagoguery and   political divisiveness, is what is making the public so angry.\"  Is he right?"

And he`s really identifying the problem with our democracy before we attend to   any of the other issues that we care about from economic issues to things like climate change. We in America have to ask whether our democratic republic is as democratic as we think.  I`s one of the reasons I`ve called for some straight forward   but perhaps bold solutions like doing away with the Electoral College that twice in my lifetime has overruled the American people. I mean, when you have -- take universal background checks, a commonsense gun policy, that`s something like 80 or 90 percent of Americans agree on.    If the U.S. Congress can`t deliver something that that many Americans, including most Republicans believe is the right thing to do, is evidence   that money and the drawing of constituency lines so that politicians are choosing their voters instead of the other way around, it`s evidence that   our democracy has become warped almost beyond recognition and needs to be reformed immediately."

      "text": "Well, the problem that we have to solve is that the Supreme Court is on a trajectory toward coming to be viewed as a nakedly political   body by many Americans, we need to stop that before it`s too late.  And so, I think we need to entertain a range of reforms that would make the Supreme   Court less political so that each vacancy didn`t become another apocalyptic ideological battle. For example, it may be possible, without even amending the Constitution, to adjust the structure of the Supreme Court so that it had 15 members but   only 10 of them were appointed politically, the other were rotated up from the appellate bench and could only be seated by unanimous consensus among   the other 10.  That`s just one of a number of reforms that have been proposed and I don`t presume to know what the exact right answer is.  I do   believe that something that may be in the past was considered off limits because it`s too deep or too structural.  These kinds of things need to be   entertained because our democracy is very much in danger of slipping away from us. You know, Freedom House did its assessment of freedom and democracy around the world and the United States rankings are slipping, some say that we`re   in a democracy recession globally.  And here at home, I`m very much worried that democracy is in retreat unless we repair our institutions, something   that we used to be willing to do through statute and constitutional change, every generation would see some range of reforms take place. And for some reason, that`s just stopped short.  And if anything, we`re growing less democratic in my lifetime with measures to make it more   difficult for many Americans to vote and increasing distortion with the role of money in our politics too."

And I think fundamentally, this election isn`t about him. Look, an election against a candidate as flawed as he was in 2016, that should never have even come within cheating distance, so to speak, it   should never have been close.  I believe that for an election result like that, for a presidency like this even to be possible there must be more   profound issues in our economy and democracy such that the problem, if it weren`t him, could very well be somebody else causing similar damage. Of course, he needs to be defeated, when he says something false it needs to be corrected, when he does something wrong it needs to be confronted.    But fundamentally, this election can`t be simply about him.  If the message is all about him, I can tell you that once again a lot of people,   especially in the industrial regions where I live, will say that nobody`s talking about me.  We have to talk about lived every day experience of   people in their lives across America and how our values and the policies that flow from those values will make every day of life better.  It can`t   be all about him, that`s the show and he`s very good at making that show all about him. But when I talk about -- when I talk to neighbors about what`s really impacting our lives and will ultimately drive our political choices, it`s   not what`s going on in Washington, it`s what`s going on in our neighborhoods, in our communities.  And part of the purpose of coming from   local office trying to enter a national conversation is to remind everybody of what`s really at stake so that we can build a message that will make   sense even when this presidency comes and goes, we`ll have as much to say to the world in 2040, in 2050 as we do in 2020."

And the thing that made me realize I needed to come out was after my deployment to Afghanistan, I really was forced to   confront the fact that I only had one life, that it was limited, that I wanted to get on with the personal life, begin dating. And so, I made the decision that I needed to come out for personal reasons at an inconvenient time.  I was running for reelection, Mike Pence was the   governor of my state at the time, but I knew that it was something I had to do.  My community is socially conservative and we didn`t know what the   response would be.  But when I explain myself and continued going about doing my job, I wound up getting reelected with 80 percent of the vote. So, I think what we`ve learned is that more than anything, people want to know what you care about, what your values are, what your ideas are and   what kind of jobs you can do for them.  That`s how I`m evaluated by my constituents here at home in South Bend. And of course, I`m proud of my marriage.  I married a teacher and that marriage is one of the most important things in my life.  It`s also, by the   way, something that exists only by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court, which is why people like me can never forget why politics   matters and how it can affect our everyday lives in so many ways. As to the question of whether America is ready for that, the best answer I can give is that there`s only one way to find out for sure."

Maybe the most important thing I took from it was a better sense of what it was to be an American, because the people that I served with,   especially when I was responsible for driving or guarding vehicles on convoys movements, which is a big part of my job when I was posted in   Kabul, was that, you know, we would learn to trust each other with our lives regardless of our backgrounds.  People getting into my vehicle didn`t   care if I was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend or what country my father had immigrated from or whether I was a Democrat or Republican, we   simply learn to trust each other with our lives. And in a broader sense, I think that`s what has to happen in America but you shouldn`t have to go to war in order to have that experience.  I   believe that national service is something we need to create more opportunities for here at home and we really need to learn from all of the   ways in which for prior generations. Military service was often a leveler, an equalizer, something that made it possible for people like a young John F. Kennedy or George H.W. Bush to   learn how to relate on more or less equal terms with the sons of factory workers and farmers in places like Indiana.  And it`s unfortunate that   we`ve lost that to some degree, but I think there`s a chance, certainly not now led by a president who is credibly accused of faking a disability in   order to avoid service when it was his turn. But I do think there`s an opportunity to restore a culture of service to the heart of what it means to be in this country."

Helen Singer Kaplan was the first sex therapist at Cornell Medical School and I worked with her   for seven years, two years being trained, five years training others so I`m very fortunate. Also, I`m very Jewish.  And in the Jewish tradition, in the Talmud, it says a lesson taught with humor is a lesson retained.  Not a joke.  I couldn`t   tell you a joke but I can hear some question and answer with humor like what I told that woman, keep your mouth shut.  Don`t tell about your past.    That`s the past.  Live right now and make the best of it. So, it`s a little bit the combination of being very well trained, psychology from the Sorbonne, Masters in Sociology, Doctorate Columbia   University Teachers College where I`m now teaching and I`m also teaching at Hunter.  So, that combination helped.  And what helped is that I loved what   I`m doing.  I love that people, because of the accent, what has happened to me, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in my case, could have only happened in New   York because New Yorkers were very generous with people with accents.

So what affects that ecosystem affects the livelihoods of over 230 million people who inhabit the region and there are manifold reasons how this   effect plays out to hearty mountain people.  They are very adaptable and resilient by their nature but this is -- and they tend to be somewhat   poorer than the rest of the people down the river.  And they`re going to suffer the consequences of this stress on the ecosystem first."

Pumori on the right and we are   about to cross this ridge and fly right over base camp. The peak on the right is Nuptse.  The peak in the middle is Lhotse.  We`re looking down on the Khumbu Icefall and we`re working our way up into the   Western Cwm. The route to the top of Everest goes straight up the middle of the ice field in the middle and traverses to the left in that saddle, the cold   between Everest and Lhotse.  So we`re looking at it right now.  That would be the high camp at 26,000 feet. And now we`re going to turn around.  We`re looking at the route now from -- on the right-hand skyline, from the high camp to the top and now we`re   flying back down the Western Cwm, the route of our ascent. Right now, many hundreds of climbers are gathered there for the spring climbing season and we`re flying back out over the Icefall.  In the   distance is Cho Oyu, the world`s sixth highest mountain.  And so we`ve just seen four of the world`s highest mountains."

International Center for   Integrated Mountain Development in Katmandu published a recent report and their science is very good. I use the images around the world for a Glacierworks exhibit called \"Rivers of Ice, Vanishing Glaciers of the Greater Himalaya\".  And that starts a   conversation, the big gap, from, say, 1899 to when I re-photographed the same place 110 years later. Now, let`s carry the conversation further.  The glaciers are melting.  Some of the melt rate years ago was through more natural causes. Now, it`s greatly accelerated and what does that tell us about the future? Glacierworks and the work I do is mostly used for education and exhibits   and to help start a conversation about adaptability and resilience."

And what happened were a couple of teams climbing   very high on the mountain got caught out late, climbing too late. And at that same moment when they were very vulnerable, they were overcome by a fast-moving storm that was not forecasted, that was -- came out of a   different direction than we normally expect. And in that night, eight people froze to death and some were severely frostbitten.  One gentleman lost both of his hands to frostbite eventually.    And it was just complete chaos on the mountain during the storm. And it was something that we had never really seen on Everest, a mix of guiding, a mix of professional climbers, a mix of clients who are less   experienced, all within a couple of hours -- within an hour, really, in the dramatic fight for their lives."

At one point, you got to look at the tug that mountain exerts on you and all that -- all the time, effort, pride, money, training, and then --   because this causes us to engage in something very interesting.  I happened to teach this in leadership lectures, presentations, and it`s the willful   disregard of negative information. Where, at that moment, where you are close to being in extreme peril, you`re high on a mountain, you`re vulnerable, you have 300 feet left to go,   you`re tired, you`re dehydrated, you`re exhausted, you`re hypoxic, perhaps. That`s when you open your mind to negative information.  Meaning, negative information says this is not going to work out well.  Let`s turn around and   go down. And there`s also hope springs eternal, right? We`re going to get to the top.  Everything`s going to be OK."

It was almost a military operation. I think what changed the most -- for me, I was on the mountain in 2014, I was at base camp, near base camp, when a collapse above the Icefall killed   16 people.  And then I was there during the earthquake. And so I`ve been on the glacier doing work for Glacierworks when there`s 1,400 people arrayed on that glacier.  When I was there in 1985, we were   one team.  We were 38 people. And I`ve been able to go to the mountain many times and fulfill something I wanted to do in life and to make films.  I don`t know what to say about   people who have the same feelings.  They just want to get to the top. What I would say is it`s the hard work of having the skills to look after yourself without a guide that really make that climb worthwhile.  At least   for me."

      "text": "Well hello and welcome.  You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me Becky Anderson, live from London.  And   we are following breaking news.   Out of Hong Kong tensions heating up at a metro station there where protesters have staged a sit-in at the scene of an attack by suspected   Triad gang members last month.  Now demonstrators have set up barricades -- you see here -- while police are trying to disburse the crowds.   Eleven week in, remember, to these protest movements.  And once again, late at night in Hong Kong we see what looks like a smaller cohort.  Of course   remember, organizers suggest as many as 1.7 million people out with the movement over the weekend again.  Once again, authorities there suggesting   only about 127,000, this is a smaller cohort.  This is a metro station.  It's 11:00 p.m.  at night.   CNN's Will Ripley is in Hong Kong and on his way to the station.  I'm going to get to him as soon as I can for you.  First, let's get you to Matt   Rivers who is in Beijing.  Matt, firstly, are you even seeing these images in Beijing?"

      "text": "Well, you know, it's interesting question, Becky.  Because China generally has censored a lot of   these images, starting towards the beginning of these protests when they began more than two months ago.  But you know, if this really turns violent   tonight, if the we see tear gas, if we see protesters clashing with police, those are the mages that Beijing wants to show the rest of the world.   You just talk about the 1.7 million according to organizers.  The 1.7 million people that came out over the weekend.  Now let's remind our   viewers, they were peaceful.  They retook the mantle that the protests when they first began in early June and mid-June, they were built upon peaceful   protests, centering on a pro-democracy message, on a message of being fearful of increasing encroachment from Beijing.   And the amount of people that we have seen be violent in these protests are in a very small fraction of the amount of people we have seen in the   streets.  And yet that is the image that Beijing wants to put to the rest of the world.  They don't want people talking about the fact that 1.7   million peacefully marched on their own through the streets of Hong Kong.  They want you right now, the international viewer, to focus on the fact   there are at most several thousand who engaged in violence on a regular basis.  Several thousand out of more than a billion people.  We are talking   about fractions of a percentage.  And that is what Beijing wants to focus on.  So it's interesting.   You know, Beijing is probably going to let some of the images come through.  But fact of the matter is there are protesters that are violent, and what   we could see tonight is repeat of violence.  It's interesting that this is happening.  The MTR station -- as  you mentioned off the top -- that is the   scene where protesters were incredibly angry about a month ago.  Because as people were heading home, there were Triad gang members -- a gang that has   been operating in Hong Kong.  They've been at the China border for decades now.   They are suspected Triad members that savagely beat people who were engaging largely in peaceful protests on the way home, after engaging in   protests.  And the police for 45 minutes did nothing as people were beaten inside that station.  That is the reason why protesters have chosen to do   that sit in tonight, Becky, and we'll have to see where it goes in terms of violence."

And now you have this MTR station, significant because of what happened there a month ago, the stabbing   incident, tied to the Triad, suspected of connections to the Chinese government.   And now you have a small group of protesters here demanding that they will deliver a message.  Wearing gas masks and helmets and prepared   for a confrontation with police that they feel is imminent.  But now Beijing and certainly some aspects of Hong Kong city government can   continue to make a case that these protests are violent and act of terror.  Even though earlier in the day you have much, much larger groups peacefully   staging a sit in, peacefully protesting over the weekend, with an estimated up to 1.7 million people, and no outbreaks of violence.  And now a few days   later, you have a very small group getting a lot of attention for activities that are highly disruptive."

We've come deep into Venezuela's mining ark to find out how Nicolas Maduro is holding on to power and able to resist American pressure.

Some call the whole uproar over Greenland a distraction from real issues.   And while that may be true in part, there could also be real consequences when it comes to diplomacy.  The U.S. wants help from its allies on   everything from guarding shipping in the Strait of Hormuz to denying assistance to an Iranian oil tanker just released by Gibraltar amongst   other things.

You know, this story was   initially perhaps treated with a bit of bemusement and some ridicule that the President wanted to buy Greenland.

Interestingly though, you mention the alliance, the importance of the relationship between Denmark and the United States.  But actually I think   that was nowhere better seen today than the response we got from the Prime Minister.  Because while we had lots of politicians across the political   spectrum actually, all united in insert of shock and offense over the fact that the President has cancelled what was a state visit.  He was invited by   the Queen.  The Prime Minister took a much more reserved, conservative diplomatic line.  Take a listen to what she said."

And one can only assume that the kind of rhetoric that we hear when President Trump talks about buying Greenland or cancelling a trip to   Denmark because Greenland turns out not to be for sale does in same ways damage his relationship with European governments.   He's also put an enormous pressure on the Europeans by pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, leaving the Europeans in a situation where essentially,   they cannot fulfill their end of the bargain with regards to Iran.  Because U.S. independent companies have threatened to stop doing business with   Europeans if they continue to work with the Iranians.  And all of this makes for a very muddled policy when it comes to Iran and to garnering   support for European nations who will be crucial in any further actions against this country -- Becky."

Some people have said that all of these controversies over the last few days are yet another example of how the President whips   up fervors to disguise bad political developments and to distract people.   I've never been a big fan of that idea just because it sort of suggests a level of strategizing on the part of Donald Trump that doesn't seem to be   there.  This is an impulsive President.  He's making U.S. foreign policy and even U.S. domestic policy a reflection of his character.  He is   erratic, unpredictable, sometimes vengeful, and transactional character.

There are   multiple things every day in any other presidency would seem like lunacy honestly.  And so, if he's trying to distract, is he trying to distract   from the situation with Iran, the lack of success with North Korea, on the economy.  I think what this is, it is just showing a window into who Donald   Trump really is.  Those comments were very offensive to the American Jewish community because they play into the trope of loyalty that has been used   against them.   This at the same time the President is accusing members of the Democratic Party of being anti-Semitic.  So he's almost committing the same   transgression that he's accusing others of using.  That is also very interesting because it shows another aspect of the President's character.    In the way that foreign policy now is basically leveraged as to how it will help the President politically.   He's made the U.S. relationship with Israel hyper politicized.  Part of the reason for that is because evangelical voters -- who are strongly   supportive of Israel -- are a very important component of the Trump base.  This is going to have aftereffects down the road.  There are a lot of   Israel's friends in Washington, Republicans as well as Democrats, who are troubled by this.  Because they feel that politicizing this relationship   makes it much more troublesome for Israel to pursue its goals throughout the Congress and wider American politics.   So this is a President who's always thinking of his own personal advantage and his comments reflect his character and I think that's what we're   seeing.  Rather than some kind of strategized effort to distract from whatever crisis seems to be bubbling up at whatever moment of any day."

Sudan has sworn in its new transitional council that will lead the country to new elections.  The council will govern for a three-year period.  It was   put together by country's generals and opposition alliance after a power- sharing deal.  This comes after months of deadly violence and ousting of long-term dictator, Omar Al Bashir.   Well highest ranking Catholic worldwide to be accused of sexual abuse, Cardinal George Pell has lost his appeal.  Pell said he was   disappointed with the decision.  In March he was sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexual assaulting two 13-year-old choir   boys in the 1990s.   China's foreign ministry confirms it detained an employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong who has been missing for almost two weeks.    According to Chinese foreign ministry, Simon Cheng was detained for violating the country's security administration punishment law.  The U.K.   foreign office tells CNN it is, quote, extremely concerned about Cheng, who is a Hong Kong citizen.   Taking a short break.  20 to 5:00 in London.  Back after this."

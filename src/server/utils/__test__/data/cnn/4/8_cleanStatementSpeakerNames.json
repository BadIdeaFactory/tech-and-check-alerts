Just out this morning, a new CNN poll shows Joe Biden is bouncing back.  Warren and Sanders are battling for second.  And Kamala Harris, where did you go?   Take a look.  Biden has regained a double-digit lead in the new national poll out from CNN that's almost double his closest rivals, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Kamala Harris is down to 5 percent support right now.  That is on the national stage.   On the ground in the early state of Iowa, Joe Biden is hitting the air waves for the very first time with this TV ad."

You have that new ad today airing here in Iowa that really homes in on electability.  He's talking about President Trump -- or a narrator in the ad talking about President Trump is an erratic vicious bully and trying to paint Joe Biden as the strong stable leader.

We've heard from Wilbur Ross, Kellyanne Conway, Larry Kudlow, all saying the fundamentals of the economy are strong.   If that's the case, it really sort of contradicts this idea that they're looking for ways to stave off an economic slowdown. Larry Kudlow, for example, scheduling a series of talks this week with business leaders to get their input on the state of the economy to find out how they feel about the future of the economy moving into 2020.  That plays a big part of this.  The White House has said that those calls were scheduled before, previous to any concern about the economy becoming part of the national dialogue.   But we know that President Trump is closely watching this.  He's spoken to aides about his concerns that this trade war with China could impact his reelection chances going into 2020.   Look, U.S. steel is shedding jobs.  There are indicators in the stock market.  The sales of R.V.s are trending down.  There are all these indicators that there could be a recession going into this election year.  And it could harm the president on what he feels is his strongest argument for another four years at the White House.   We will likely hear from the president today.  He's welcoming the president of Romania to the White House for the second time since June of 2017.  Reporters will almost certainly ask him about this.  We'll see what he says -- Kate?"

And you would want to limit it by income strat so that middle- and low-income households get it more than higher-income households because that's where the bang for the dollar is.   That said, it's a little disingenuous to say the economy is fine and then be planning for a recession.  But I do think it's prudent to hedge your downside.  I don't think it's prudent to do it by hammering on the Fed and doing things like that.  That is really undermining your own potential to fight a recession down the road because you undermine the credibility of the Federal Reserve.   But what we do have right now is an economy where the consumer is sort of played out, carrying us right now.  And the question is, can that continue or are they going to collapse under the burden of that weight."

What the generals have been saying for the last several months is you are going to have guerrilla attacks, suicide bombers and ISIS migrating well beyond Syria and Iraq, into North Africa where it's been operating for some time, and, in recent years, up in Afghanistan.

You have that new ad today airing here in Iowa that really homes in on electability.  He's talking about President Trump -- or a narrator in the ad talking about President Trump is an erratic vicious bully and trying to paint Joe Biden as the strong stable leader.   And so these poll numbers are really backing up the central message that Biden has had throughout his campaign that what Democrats need to do is pick a nominee that can take on President Trump and they believe that it's Joe Biden for that position."

What I think we're learning here is debates can matter to a point. That poll that we're comparing it to, Kate, was taken in the immediate aftermath when Kamala Harris delivered that punch to Joe Biden over busing.  And she got a bunch of positive press coverage out of that and he had a bunch of negative headlines about his debate performance. And that's when that snapshot was taken.   So now what we're seeing, past a couple of series of debates now, is we're returning a bit to where we were before.  Biden is back up, double-digit lead.  Kamala Harris back down to the middle single digits where she was before that moment.  It was a bit of a sugar high, I think, in that immediate aftermath of that Miami debate."

The White House publicly has denied that they're under consideration at this time.   But this belies what we've heard from White House officials over the last few days, including the sound byte you played from President Trump there, across the board.  We've heard from Wilbur Ross, Kellyanne Conway, Larry Kudlow, all saying the fundamentals of the economy are strong.   If that's the case, it really sort of contradicts this idea that they're looking for ways to stave off an economic slowdown. Larry Kudlow, for example, scheduling a series of talks this week with business leaders to get their input on the state of the economy to find out how they feel about the future of the economy moving into 2020.  That plays a big part of this.  The White House has said that those calls were scheduled before, previous to any concern about the economy becoming part of the national dialogue.   But we know that President Trump is closely watching this.  He's spoken to aides about his concerns that this trade war with China could impact his reelection chances going into 2020.   Look, U.S. steel is shedding jobs.  There are indicators in the stock market.  The sales of R.V.s are trending down.  There are all these indicators that there could be a recession going into this election year.  And it could harm the president on what he feels is his strongest argument for another four years at the White House.   We will likely hear from the president today.  He's welcoming the president of Romania to the White House for the second time since June of 2017.  Reporters will almost certainly ask him about this.  We'll see what he says -- Kate?"

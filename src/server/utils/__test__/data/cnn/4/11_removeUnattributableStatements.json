That said, it's a little disingenuous to say the economy is fine and then be planning for a recession.  But I do think it's prudent to hedge your downside.  I don't think it's prudent to do it by hammering on the Fed and doing things like that.  That is really undermining your own potential to fight a recession down the road because you undermine the credibility of the Federal Reserve.   But what we do have right now is an economy where the consumer is sort of played out, carrying us right now.

After forwarding a tweet that compares him to the Second Coming of God, President Trump declares himself \"the chosen one\" to deal with China.  He also calls himself \"wonderful\" and \"responsible for great things.\"   Is he drinking his own Kool-Aid? Annoyed by allies:  the president calls Denmark's prime minister \"nasty\" for labeling his desire to buy Greenland \"absurd\"  but he calls on other allies to let Russia back into the G8 group of industrialized nations.   Why is he so eager to embrace Vladimir Putin? Reversing course:  the president flip-flops on gun background checks, saying he wants to fix loopholes but stresses that the nation already has strong background checks.  And after saying he was weighing a payroll tax cut, the president says he is no longer looking at a payroll tax cut. And K-Pop revolution:  South Korea's pop music has fans around the world, including North Korea's Kim Jong-un.   But can the dictator stop K-Pop from luring away defectors?

Now I'm told that the President Macron threw out the idea, trying to basically put the onus on Trump to be the one to own the idea and he's doing just that.  But imagine how controversial and dramatic it could be if President Putin came here to the U.S. for a G7 meeting just months ahead of the 2020 presidential election here.   Obviously that would be controversial, because we know that every intelligence agency says that it is Russia who meddled in the 2016 elections and President Trump has never gone that far and agreed with them.   So it would be pretty dramatic if he were here in the United States. The other thing to consider is that Trump is headed to the G7 this weekend.  And we know that he's going to be discussing this topic with other members of the G7, who have agreed that Russia shouldn't be allowed back in.   But Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the U.K., a new leader that President Trump is hoping will see eye to eye with, just said today he doesn't even think there is a case yet to be made for Russia to be allowed back in.  So that could create tension between the two leaders who are hoping to start off a good foot."

The U.S. has been allowed to use strategic bases in Greenland since the Cold War, that allows the U.S. to listen in on Russia and other things across the Arctic and the Danish troops have fought alongside U.S. soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan; 43 Danish troops died in Afghanistan fighting alongside U.S. soldiers.

There was a mass movement there at that time.   And the feeling -- you might have -- we may have polls.  But the feeling, the people in the streets is not like it was.

What's in place right now is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, and that puts a cap on the amount of time that migrant children can be held at 20 days.  They want to remove that cap, and there's no maximum.  So in essence, that means that children could be held with their parents indefinitely.   Now, today, the Secretary -- the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, said that the Flores Agreement creates an incentive for families to come illegally because they know that they can be released while their immigration proceedings go on after those 20 days when their kids are.  Let's take a listen."

It will be published on Friday, and if there were no court opposition, no legal opposition, it would go into effect in 60 days.   There will certainly be opposition.  We've already heard from the lawyers from the Flores Settlement.  They said that they're going to file a brief with the Flores judge and that if the government goes ahead with this, they will be in breach.

But imagine how controversial and dramatic it could be if President Putin came here to the U.S. for a G7 meeting just months ahead of the 2020 presidential election here.   Obviously that would be controversial, because we know that every intelligence agency says that it is Russia who meddled in the 2016 elections and President Trump has never gone that far and agreed with them.   So it would be pretty dramatic if he were here in the United States. The other thing to consider is that Trump is headed to the G7 this weekend.

But the important thing here is that both Danish officials and folks who live there are feeling a little bit like they've been treated unfairly here because they have stood next to the U.S. for years, especially when it comes to national security.   The U.S. has been allowed to use strategic bases in Greenland since the Cold War, that allows the U.S. to listen in on Russia and other things across the Arctic and the Danish troops have fought alongside U.S. soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan; 43 Danish troops died in Afghanistan fighting alongside U.S. soldiers.   So there is clearly some hard feelings here and we're going to have to see how the relationship moves forward at this point."

They want to remove that cap, and there's no maximum.  So in essence, that means that children could be held with their parents indefinitely.

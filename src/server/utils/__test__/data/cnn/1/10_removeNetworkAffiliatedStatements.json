But this was after several days of concern, really, the U.S. had launched, as you mentioned, a last-minute petition from the Justice Department to try to prevent that ship from being released. Then U.S. claiming that it had nearly a million dollars in cash, as well as a substantial amount of oil on board that was being used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the IRGC, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. since April to be deployed to help the regime of Bashar al Assad in Syria. The Gibraltarian authorities ultimately deciding not to honor that request from the U.S., explaining their logic, basically saying that EU law does not view the IRGC as a terrorist organization.  So the question now becomes, what happens to the British tanker that is being held here in the port of Bander Abbas in Iran? Will the Iranians now release it as is expected today? The Iranians saying that it will require a court order before they are willing to do that.  John."

This Pakistani suicide bomber, working for ISIS, walking into the crowded part of a wedding celebration. Weddings are a key part of the social calendar. The only real moment of joy, frankly, in a Kabul capital city which is seeing suicide bombings on a daily basis, but nothing quite as ghastly as this.  Now, the devastating scenes that many working on the talks with the Taliban to say this is a reason why we need the peace deal with the Taliban, with the United States, so they can focus on fighting ISIS. Some say, though, that's pretty complicated because you're essentially getting into bed or learning to trust the Taliban, who originally sheltered al Qaeda and are still pretty chummy with him, asked if he trust his negotiators here. This is what President Donald Trump had to say."

So much of the discussions are about what kind of U.S. presence would be allowed.  There's a huge sticking point, though, in this deal, which we're told by sources close to it is 99 percent complete. And that is between the Americans and the Taliban. And it involves a cease-fire between just the Americans and the Taliban, allowing critics of the deal saying potentially the Taliban to continue targeting the Afghan government and army there. That's a recipe for more loss of life in Afghanistan, but the talk -- the clock is certainly ticking now on Donald Trump and when he makes this announcement about a deal, if he can agree to it.

The Cubs and Pirates moving the finale of their series to Williamsport, playing in front of just 2,500 fans. And Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo taking in all the fun. You see him doing some sledding before the game.  Then Rizzo showing the little guys how it's done with a huge blast in the fifth inning. He ended up getting this ball back because it bounced off the scoreboard for a home run. And then he told his teammate, Yu Darvish, he wanted to give it to the shortstop from Japan because he thought he was going to be a really good player. Well, Yu helped him translate that and make it happen. A fun night for all of those involved. The Cubs would get the win 7-1. Now earlier in the day Maddy Freking becoming the first girl to play in the Little League World Series since Mo'ne Davis back in 2014. Freking entered in the second inning, got a batter looking. She's just the sixth girl to pitch at Williamsport. The 12-year-old also making a great play in that inning. Virginia ended up winning that game 11 to nothing, ending Freking and Minnesota's run at the Little League World Series.  You know, Mo'ne Davis, Alisyn, has moved on to play college softball. But Freking says she's sticking with baseball. She's got no plans switching to softball."

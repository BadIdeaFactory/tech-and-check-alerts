<h3>About This Alert</h3>

<p>This daily email is part of an experimental, automated alert service developed by the Duke Reportersâ€™ Lab as part of our Tech &amp; Check Cooperative. The alerts are computer-generated tip sheets designed to help journalists identify statements from the last 24 hours that are newsworthy enough to fact-check. The alerts are not intended for broader public distribution. No humans on the Tech &amp; Check team reviewed or verified the accuracy of these statements or their attribution before this alert was sent.</p>

<p>The statements above from CNN are based on the network's "rush" transcripts. Please verify quotes and speakers by checking the original video. Statements from Twitter were gathered from a selected list of official Twitter accounts, including the feeds of candidates, elected officials and state and national party organizations.</p>

<p>The alerts are generated using the ClaimBuster algorithm developed by computer scientists at the University of Texas, Arlington. ClaimBuster ranks each statement based on its potential "checkability" -- NOT its accuracy. You can learn more about how that works on the ClaimBuster site (<a href="https://idir.uta.edu/claimbuster/">https://idir.uta.edu/claimbuster/</a>).</p>

<p>Please send any feedback to Tech &amp; Check project manager Erica Ryan (<a href="mailto:elryan@gmail.com">elryan@gmail.com</a>).</p>

<p>Best,<br>
